OData Unassign

As a Fiori Administrator you will sometimes face the need to unassign system alias names to the OData services. These services  play a crucial part in Fiori app runtime.

This activity needs to be done as part of a Fiori Client Copy postprocessing or you may just want to clean-up your system configuration, however, this task needs to be done manually - meaning - you need to manually process hundreds or thousands of OData services in transaction /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE.

The OData Unassign program was created by the SAP S/4HANA RIG team hoping to solve this challenges and thanks to the positive feedback from our projects we have made this program publicly available.

You can find an easy to follow user-guide at: 

As this is not an official SAP delivered program and it is based on our project experiences, if yoy rely upon this software or program, you do so at your own risk, and you assume the responsibility for the results.

So please make sure you perform appropiate tests before moving to a production environment.

Enjoy!
